mycobot_v3: May 29th, 2023 -> mycobot_instance: May 30th, 2023
    Driver parameters updated.
    Generated based on mycobot_v3
    Bugs:
	1. env_0 initialization, gripper gets twisted;
	2. gear_joint is not working;
	3. tip cannot be applied to RigidPrimView, instead of just  XformPrimView. 

mycobot_v4: June 1st, 2023 -> mycobot_v4_instance.usd
    1. Add distance between the flange and gripper base
    2. Disable collidor of two gear joints
    3. Move tip out of the xform, gripper_base and create a new Xform "_tip" to help retrieving RigidPrimView.
